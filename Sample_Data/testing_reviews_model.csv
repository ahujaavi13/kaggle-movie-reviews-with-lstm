MI 6,A lovely evening spent watching tom cruise in mission impossible 6. Totally worth the time
Stree,Stree started off not so terribly but had one of the worst endings although Rajkumar Rao was fantastic
Dangal,watching amir khan in dangaal has been an absolute delight. One of the best movies of recent times
Sacred Games,Although very interesting and thrilling from the start it seemed to be a stretch after a while with predictable twists.The acting and cinematography is brilliant but plot could have been better
