# **Movie reviews with LSTM**

In this repository I have tried to perform `sentiment analysis` using imdb movie reviews data available in Kaggle. Download it from **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/data)**.
While doing that I have also leveraged pre-trained word embeddings by google which is an example of `transfer learning`. For this I have used Google's word2vec embedding.
Read about it more from **[here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)** and download it from **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/ymtoo86/googlenews-vectors-negative300)**.

## Data

I have tried to predict the probability of a review getting a rating of more than 7. The complete dataset
has been downloaded from `Kaggle` and the inspiration is drawn from a competition which can be viewed **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial)**. The
code currently generates submission file which can submitted to the competition to benchmark its accuracy. The current accuracy is slightly over .8 (not bad but scope of improvement)

Once the algorithm is ready and tuned properly it will do sentiment classification as it has been illustrated below from a dummy review data that has been created and kept in
`Sample_Data`. Input the reviews of your own. The predictions on my reviews are coming as follows  

| id           | review                                                                                                                                                                                                | Prob rating >= 7 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| MI 6         | A lovely evening spent watching tom cruise in mission impossible 6.   Totally worth the time                                                                                                          | 1                |
| Stree        | Stree started off not so terribly but had one of the worst endings   although Rajkumar Rao was fantastic                                                                                              | 0.000176944      |
| Dangal       | watching amir khan in dangaal has been an absolute delight. One of the   best movies of recent times                                                                                                  | 0.95155108       |
| Sacred Games | Although very interesting and thrilling from the start it seemed to be a   stretch after a while with predictable twists.The acting and cinematography   is brilliant but plot could have been better | 0.223794714      |

The distribution of the probabilities are as follows which seem to align with the nature of the reviews

The ROC curve for the current model is as follows
